    <h2 id="1"><u>How to see more of what you want on instagram</u></h2>
    
<p1>
    It’s important to us that you feel good about the time you spend on Instagram, so we’re always working on ways to give you more control over what you see. Our ranked feed prioritizes posts we think you’re most likely to enjoy, but we understand that we may not always get it right. There are a number of ways you can shape your experience on Instagram and see more of what you want on your feed.

Understand how we personalize your feed
One of the ways we personalize your feed is by predicting how likely you are to do something with a post you see. The more likely you are to take an action, and the more heavily we weigh that action, the higher up you’ll see the post in your feed. There are many interactions we take into consideration, but five interactions we look at most closely are how likely you are to spend a few seconds on a post, comment on it, like it, reshare it, and tap on the profile photo. You can learn more about the signals that help us personalize your Instagram here.

Add accounts to Favorites and see their posts higher in your feed
When you add an account to your Favorites, you’ll see their posts higher and more often. And you can see a dedicated feed of just your favorites to quickly catch up on their posts. There are no suggested posts in this view, and we never share who’s in your Favorites list. To choose your Favorites, tap the Instagram logo at the top left and add up to 50 friends, family members, creators, or businesses. You can also tap the three-dot menu on any post and then select ‘Add to favorites’ directly from your feed.

<h2 id="2"><u>Create Hands-Free on Instagram With Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Smartphones</u></h2>
<p1>
    Today, we’re introducing a new way to create hands-free on Instagram with Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4, as well as other Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Smartphones. Alongside other Meta apps that are improved to work with these devices, Instagram will now adapt to and provide you with the best experience on these phones when you flip them.

With FlexCam on Galaxy Z Flip4, you can fold the phone and place it on a surface freestanding to record hand-free videos. Now you can create Stories and Reels without a stand or tripod.
Using Instagram with FlexCam makes it easier to record dances, how-to's, and your favorite moments from afar, while on-the-go.

We’ll continue improving the experience for people who use Instagram on Android, across all kinds of current and future devices. Each day, we’re building better features for Android, like faster load times and support for higher resolution videos.

We’re always working on ways to make Instagram better and help you create what’s next.

<h2 id="3"><u>Bringing Digital Collectibles to More People</u></h2>
<p1>
    Earlier this year, we began testing digital collectibles on Instagram and starting today, we will expand the ability for people, creators, businesses and collectors to share digital collectibles they created or own. Additionally, we now support wallet connections with the Coinbase Wallet and Dapper, as well as the ability to post digital collectibles minted on the Flow blockchain. We’ve been so inspired by the creators who have shared their digital collectibles. Natalie Amrossi (@misshattan), an aerial and street photographer, used the feature to drive awareness of some of her work and in return, has seen an increase in sales. We have also seen people share and display NFT artwork they have collected to support their fellow creators.
    "NFTs have opened the doors to new opportunities for me and other artists around the world. This new technology provides us with another outlet to make a living and to connect with our fans and collectors. Instagram has helped build careers for so many creatives, including myself, and now our communities can support us further by sharing our work on the platform.”
    Expanding access to more people
    Today we’re starting international expansion to 100 countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and the Americas. In order to post a digital collectible, all you need to do is connect your digital wallet to Instagram. As of today, we support connections with third-party wallets including Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet and Dapper Wallet. Supported blockchains at this time include Ethereum, Polygon and Flow. There are no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram.
    
    Our continued commitment to equity, safety and sustainability
    It’s critical that we continue to build in this space responsibly by reducing barriers to entry, making sure that this technology is safe and approachable for people, and reducing the environmental impact of our product. Here’s what we’re doing to achieve this:
    
    We focus on empowering diverse voices. Through this expansion, we aim to improve accessibility and help make the NFT space more inclusive. NFTs have made it possible for more diverse artists to gain exposure and monetize their work outside of traditional channels. By enabling more people around the world to share their digital collectibles on Instagram, we’re able to open new pathways for artistic connection and monetization.
    We want Instagram to be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone. Therefore, people can use our tools to keep their accounts secure and report digital collectibles which go against our community guidelines.
    We are committed to building in this space with sustainability in mind. Meta will help reduce the emissions impact that might be associated with the display of digital collectibles on Instagram by purchasing renewable energy. Learn more about our commitment to sustainability here.
    What’s next?
    As access to digital collectibles expands, we aim to educate broad audiences on the space, including through our @creators’ ‘NFTeach Me’ series.
    
    Across Meta, we’re exploring a wide range of web3 technologies because we believe they will expand access, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation, empowering people and creators around the world. We are excited to continue listening to feedback from creators and collectors as we continue to build in this space.

<h2 id="4"><u>Understanding How Different Communities Experience Instagram</u></h2>
<p1>
    When we established the Equity team, we wanted to understand how people from historically marginalized communities experience Instagram. For the last two years, we prioritized extensive research to better understand the concerns raised by these communities, and we made significant improvements in our products as a result. However, if we don’t know people's race or ethnicity, we’re limited in our ability to assess how our products impact different communities.

To better understand different experiences people may have on Instagram we need to collect and measure demographic information, like race and ethnicity. Starting today, we'll ask a random assortment of people on Instagram in the United States to participate in an optional survey where they can share this information.

How it Works
Over the next few months, people on Instagram in the United States may see a prompt asking them for their race or ethnicity. This leads to a survey hosted by YouGov, an international research group that helps companies securely run surveys. Individual, de-identified responses are collected by YouGov, encrypted, and split into parts to be stored across partner research institutions. Instagram will only have access to aggregated information, which means we can’t connect people or their Instagram accounts to their individual responses. More details on how this methodology works are available in our technical paper.

<h2 id="5"><u>Introducing New Ways to Collaborate and Create with Reels</u></h2>
<p1>
    Today, we're announcing new features to Instagram that make it more fun and easy to collaborate, create and share reels.

More Ways to Collaborate with Enhanced Remix Features
We’re expanding our tools for Remix to help enhance the way you tell stories on Instagram when collaborating with your favorite creators and friends, including:

Remix for photos: Photos are core to the Instagram experience. In the coming weeks, you will be able to remix public photos. This gives you limitless inspiration to create your own unique reel.
Expanded Remix layouts: Choose between a green screen, horizontal or vertical split-screen, or picture-in-picture reaction view to add your own video commentary to existing reels.
Add your clip: Have a hot take? Rather than having your remix appear at the same time as the original reel, you can now add your clip after the original so it plays sequentially.

<h2 id="6"><u>Instagram and Brooklyn Museum Debut 2022 #BlackVisionaries Program With $650,000 in Grants</u></h2>
<p1>To empower, center and invest in aspiring Black voices within art and design, we are debuting the 2022 #BlackVisionaries program together with the Brooklyn Museum. As part of this debut, we are awarding $650,000 in grants to Black artists, Black designers and Black small businesses.

    For the last three years, we’ve collaborated with the Brooklyn Museum and Antwaun Sargent (writer, curator & #BlackVisionaries Creative Chair) to uplift and support historically excluded creative voices. And today we work together to uplift, center and invest in Black voices and organizations working in art and design.
    
    Last year, the #BlackVisionaries program awarded five Black designers, including a Black-led small design business, $205,000 in grants. This year, we will award 10 #BlackVisionaries grants in partnership with the Brooklyn Museum. This includes five $100,000 Visionary Small Business Grants for Black-led organizations in the US focused on design.
    
    With the support of Meta Open Arts, we’re also awarding five $30,000 Emerging Visionary Grants for individuals focused on art and design based in the U.S.
    
    Applications for this year’s #BlackVisionaries program open on June 28 and close on July 29, and you can apply here.
    
    Instagram and the Brooklyn Museum will also award mentorship to each grant recipient together with Mobile Makers, a nonprofit organization that offers youth design and skill-building workshops in Chicago and Boston communities.
    
    Grant recipients will be selected by a committee of artists and designers led by Antwaun Sargent, including Elle Decor Editor-in-Chief Asad Syrkett, Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth Carter and Head of Design at Instagram Ian Spalter.
    
    “Most folks who don’t have traditional pathways into spaces like the arts and design just need opportunity,” says Sargent. “A grant like this could mean a world of opportunity.”
